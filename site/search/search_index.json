Introduction</p> <p>Hello everyone! I'm happy to welcome you to the first lesson of our course about working with CloudCompare and 3D point clouds. My name is Artur Mukhametshin, and I will be one of your teachers for this course. I have experience working with point clouds that I got from processing data from drone flights. CloudCompare has helped me a lot with this work. Because of this, I have good experience using this program.</p> <p>I suggest that each of you introduce yourself and tell us if you are really interested in this course, or if your boss made you take it.</p> <p>Great! Now that we know each other a little bit, let's talk about what we will do in the first lesson. Today, we will learn the basic things about working with 3D point clouds, and we will also learn about the tools in the powerful CloudCompare program. By the end of the lesson, you will understand what 3D point clouds are, you will be able to install and start CloudCompare, you will know how to use the program's interface, and you will be able to import and look at point cloud data.</p> <p>This course will give you useful knowledge and skills that are very needed today. You will be able to work with data from surveying, architecture, cultural heritage, and many other areas. You will be able to create, analyze, and share 3D models. This is a very useful skill that will open many new opportunities for you.</p> <p>2. Overview of CloudCompare and its Features</p> <p>So, let's start with what CloudCompare is. CloudCompare is a powerful, free, and open-source program that is made for working with 3D point clouds. It is very popular in many fields.</p> <p>What are the main things you can do with this program? CloudCompare allows us to:</p> <ul> <li>Look at and see 3D point clouds.</li> <li>Process and filter data.</li> <li>Do analysis and take measurements.</li> <li>Compare different point clouds.</li> <li>Save results in different formats.</li> </ul> <p>During our course, we will look at each of these features in detail.</p> <p>Point clouds are used everywhere today. Here are some examples. In construction and architecture, they help to create 3D models of buildings, check the quality of building work, and do surveys. In surveying and mapping, point clouds help to make accurate maps and models of the land. In cultural heritage, they help to make digital copies of historical objects to keep them safe. In industry, 3D point clouds help to check the quality of production and create prototypes.</p> <p></p> <p>3. Basic Concepts of 3D Point Clouds</p> <p>Now, let's talk about what a 3D point cloud is. Imagine that you are scanning an object or a scene. The result is a large number of points in three-dimensional space. This is a 3D point cloud. Each point has X, Y, and Z coordinates that describe its position in space. There can also be other things added, like color, reflection, or RGB.</p> <p>3D point clouds have a structure. Imagine that it's not just a pile of points, but each one has its own position. They can be organized in different ways, like a grid or a tree. The coordinates and other information help us describe the object being scanned and its features.</p> <p>There are several ways to get 3D point clouds. We can talk about two main groups: active and passive methods. Active methods include LiDAR scanners. They work by sending a laser beam and measuring the time the signal takes to return. This allows us to find the distance to the object. LiDAR scanners are often used in surveying, mapping, and when looking at areas. Structured light scanning is also an active method. In this case, a pattern (like a grid) is projected onto the object, which helps to find the three-dimensional coordinates. Passive methods include photogrammetry. In this case, a 3D model is made from a set of photos. This is a very common method in different fields.</p> <p>Knowing about 3D point clouds and how to get them will help you work with data more effectively. You will understand where the data comes from, what its special features are, and what problems it might have.</p> <p></p> <p>4. Installing and Setting Up CloudCompare</p> <p>Now, let's move on to installing CloudCompare. First, you need to download the program from the official website. Here is the link to the website: https://cloudcompare-org.danielgm.net/release/. I want to say that the program is completely free and does not require a license.</p> <p>The installation is quite easy, I will guide you through the steps now. Just follow the instructions on the screen. What should you pay attention to? First, during the installation, you will be asked to create a shortcut on the desktop, so you can quickly start the program. Also, if you plan to work with Faro data, put a checkmark next to the Faro plugin. And if you want to use Python, install its plugins too.</p> <p></p> <p>For CloudCompare to work well, it's important to have a powerful computer. The program needs a lot of resources, especially when working with large point clouds. I recommend having a strong processor and video card.</p> <p>After the installation is done, you can start the program. You should see the CloudCompare window, and we can move on to the next part of our lesson.</p> <p>5. Overview of the CloudCompare Interface</p> <p>Let's now learn about the program's interface. When you start CloudCompare, you will see the main window, where all the work with 3D data happens.</p> <p>At the top of the window, there is a menu bar. Here you will find all the main commands of the program. Below are toolbars for quick access to the main functions. On the left, you see the DB Tree, which shows all the loaded point clouds. On the right, there is the Properties panel, which shows the properties of the selected object. And at the bottom of the screen, there is the Console, where program messages and errors are shown.</p> <p></p> <p>Let's look at the toolbars. Here you will find tools for navigation, showing, and processing 3D data. The Navigation panel allows you to rotate the camera, move around in the scene, and zoom in and out. The Display panel is for setting how the point clouds are shown. And the Tools panel contains different tools for processing and analyzing 3D data. We will learn about each panel in more detail in the next lessons.</p> <p>In the Properties panel, you can see different details about the selected object, like the number of points, coordinates, and other information. In the Console, you can see messages about the program's actions and errors. This is a very important tool for checking the data processing.</p> <p>I will give you a few minutes to look at the program's interface yourself, move the mouse around, and see where everything is located.</p> <p>6. Basic Navigation and Viewing Tools</p> <p>Now let's talk about how to move around and view data in a 3D scene. In CloudCompare, there are several tools for navigation. To pan (move across the scene), you need to press and hold the Shift key and move the mouse cursor on the screen. To rotate, press and hold the left mouse button. To zoom in and out, use the mouse wheel. You can also rotate the camera around a selected object (Orbit); to do this, press and hold Ctrl and the left mouse button. And to center the view on a selected object, press the Auto button.</p> <p>The program also has tools for better viewing. You can turn the coordinate grid (Grid) and axes (Axis) on or off. You can change the camera settings, such as focal length and viewing angle, and you can change the scene lighting. This helps to analyze the data better.</p> <p>Don't forget about the shortcut keys. They make it much easier to use the program. For example, the Z key is used for quick zooming, and the cursor keys help you move around the scene.</p> <p>Try it yourself now, move around the scene, rotate, zoom in and out. See how the image changes when you turn the grid on and off, etc.</p> <p>7. Opening and Importing Point Cloud Data</p> <p>Now let's learn how to import 3D point clouds into CloudCompare. The program supports many formats, including LAS, PLY, XYZ, PCD, and others. The most common formats are LAS, PLY, and E57.</p> <p>There are several ways to import data. You can open a file using the File-&gt;Open menu, you can use the data manager, or you can just drag and drop a file from the file explorer into the program window.</p> <p>After importing a point cloud, you can study it. Try moving around the scene, zooming, rotating. Look at the Properties panel, where you can see how many points the cloud contains and what its features are. Look at the DB Tree, how does the structure of the loaded point cloud look.</p> <p></p> <p>8. Practical Exercise</p> <p>So, we are moving on to the practical part of our lesson. Now I will give you a sample point cloud. Your task is to:</p> <ul> <li>Import the point cloud into CloudCompare.</li> <li>Study the program's interface.</li> <li>Practice navigating the 3D scene.</li> <li>Look at the properties of the imported point cloud.</li> <li>Try out the viewing tools.</li> </ul> <p>9. Conclusion</p> <p>So, we have come to the end of our first lesson. Today we have learned about the powerful tool CloudCompare and the basics of working with 3D point clouds. You learned what a 3D point cloud is, how it is made, and where it is used. You learned how to install and start CloudCompare, how to use its interface, how to move around the scene, and how to import data. You have gained basic skills in using the program that will be useful in your future work.</p> <p>At home, I ask you to work with the program on your own, try to import other point clouds, and practice navigation and viewing. Also, ask yourself questions: what other formats does the program support, what tools are there for measuring distances.</p> <p>Your feedback is very important to me. Tell me what you liked in the lesson and what was not clear. This will help me make the next lessons more effective.</p> <p>Thank you for your participation!

These coordinates are a simple representation of the real world.</p> <p></p> <p>There are several ways to get point clouds:</p> <ul> <li>Laser Scanning (LiDAR): This technology uses a laser to measure distances. The scanner sends out light pulses that reflect off surfaces and return to the sensor. By measuring the time it takes for the light to travel, the scanner finds the distance to each point. This creates a precise 3D view of the object. LiDAR can be used on planes, drones, cars, or by hand.</li> <li>Photogrammetry: This method uses many overlapping photos of the same object. Software analyses the photos and finds the 3D coordinates of points that are visible in several photos. This makes a point cloud for creating 3D models.</li> </ul> <p>Point clouds are a powerful way to capture and show the real world in a digital way. But to use this data well, we often need to process it.</p> <p>For example, think about a point cloud that shows a city. It might have points for buildings, roads, trees, and cars. To analyze this data, we often need to choose certain things, like buildings or roads. This is why we use point cloud classification.</p> <p></p> <p>Classification is the process of dividing points into groups, or classes, based on their features. This can be height, color, reflection, shape, or other information. For example, points that show the ground can be in one class, and points that show buildings can be in another.</p> <p>Classification helps us choose the objects we want, make analysis easier, create more accurate models, and make more realistic 3D views. For example, to estimate the amount of wood in a forest or look at the condition of roads, we first need to classify the data.</p> <p>We can use CloudCompare to process point clouds. It is a free tool that lets us see and work with point clouds. It can also do classification, filtering, alignment, mesh creation, and other things.</p> <p>In this lesson, we will look at the main CloudCompare tools for classifying point clouds and creating 3D meshes.

It's a very important step in working with point clouds. Classification is about giving each point in the cloud a label or class. These labels tell us what type of object or element each point belongs to. In a city point cloud, we can have these classes:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Ground/Terrain: Points for the ground, roads, and sidewalks.</li> <li>Vegetation: Points for trees, bushes, and grass.</li> <li>Buildings: Points for buildings, walls, and other structures.</li> <li>Roads: Points for the road surface and other road parts.</li> <li>Water Bodies: Points for lakes, rivers, and ponds.</li> <li>Other: Other classes, such as power lines, cars, and fences, depending on what we need.</li> </ul> <p>Why do we need classification?</p> <p>Classification is needed for several reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Easier Analysis: It lets us select the objects we want and ignore other data, which makes analysis simpler.</li> <li>Better Modeling: It helps make more accurate 3D models, especially for architecture.</li> <li>Automation: We can use classified data to automate tasks, such as tracking changes in forests or creating land use maps.</li> <li>Basis for Other Operations: It is often the first step for other processing tasks, such as filtering, alignment, and mesh creation.</li> <li>Visualization: Classified data makes information clearer by using different colors for each class.</li> </ol> <p>Classification Methods</p> <p>There are two main ways to classify point clouds:</p> <ul> <li>Manual Classification: We select points and give them classes ourselves.

The program offers both manual and automatic classification tools for working with point clouds.</p> <p>Manual Classification in CloudCompare Manual classification is when you decide the class of each point or group of points. This is helpful when automatic methods are not good enough or when you need high accuracy. Here are the main tools:</p> <ul> <li>\"Segment\" Tool: This tool lets you select groups of points using rectangles, circles, or polygons. Selecting segments is important for manual classification. After selecting, points are assigned a class.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>\"Edit &gt; Scalar Fields &gt; Set Value\" Tool: This tool is for giving selected points a value. For classification, the value corresponds to a class. For example, if you select points for trees, you can set their value to \"Vegetation.\"</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Manual Classification Process: Manual classification involves looking at the CloudCompare window, finding the right characteristics, selecting segments, and assigning classes using the \u201cSet Value\u201d tool.</li> </ul> <p>Automatic Classification in CloudCompare CloudCompare also supports automatic classification using plugins. Plugins are add-ons that increase what the program can do. Let\u2019s consider one popular automatic classification plugin:</p> <ul> <li>CSF (Cloth Simulation Filter) Plugin: This uses a cloth simulation method to find points representing the ground. The plugin \"puts\" a cloth on the point cloud. Points under the cloth are considered ground points. Points above the cloth are considered objects like plants and buildings.<ul> <li>How it works: CSF uses physics simulation. The plugin imitates how gravity would affect a cloth over the point cloud. Points holding up the cloth are ground points.</li> <li>Main Settings: The plugin has adjustable settings like cloth size and stiffness, which change the results.</li> <li>Application: CSF is used a lot to separate ground points from vegetation and buildings.  Choosing a Classification Method</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The choice between manual and automatic classification depends on:</p> <ul> <li>Amount of Data: For small point clouds, manual is fine. For large ones, automatic is better.</li> <li>Needed Accuracy: Manual is more accurate, but takes more time. Automatic can be faster, but may need more adjustments.</li> <li>Time Limits: If time is short, automatic is better, even if the accuracy is slightly less.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>In the practical part, we will learn both methods and see their benefits and drawbacks.</p> <p>So, we have reviewed the main classification tools in CloudCompare.

Filtering helps us get rid of this noise and only keep the data we want. Here are some main reasons why filtering is important:</p> <ol> <li>Remove Noise and Unwanted Data: Filtering helps remove points that are not needed or that can affect the analysis.</li> <li>Choose Interesting Parts: We can filter to select points of a certain class, a height range, or other things.</li> <li>Prepare Data for Modeling: Before creating 3D models, we often need to filter data to get cleaner and more accurate geometry.</li> <li>Simplify Visualization: By removing unwanted points, we can improve how the point cloud looks and make it easier to understand.</li> </ol> <p>\"Filter by Value\" Tool in CloudCompare</p> <p>CloudCompare has many tools for filtering point clouds. One useful tool is \"Filter by value\". It allows you to filter points based on the values of a scalar field.</p> <ul> <li>How it works: You select a scalar field (e.g., a field with class information) and set a range of values you want to keep. Points with values in that range are kept in the new filtered point cloud, and the others are removed.<ul> <li>Example: If you want only the \"ground\" points, you choose the classification scalar field and set a range that matches the \"ground\" class.</li> <li>Creating a New Point Cloud: \"Filter by value\" doesn't change the original point cloud. It makes a new one with the filtered data.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Using the \"Filter by Value\" Tool</p> <p>This tool can be used for different purposes:</p> <ul> <li>Choosing Classes: You can use \"Filter by value\" to select points of a specific class, like just buildings or just vegetation.</li> <li>Filtering by Height: If you have height data, you can filter to select points in a certain height range, such as removing points of tree crowns to only keep the ground.</li> <li>Filtering by Intensity: If your point cloud has reflection intensity data, you can filter to select points with a certain intensity.</li> </ul> <p>Other Filtering Methods (Overview)</p> <p>Besides \"Filter by value\", CloudCompare has other filtering methods:</p> <ul> <li>Distance-Based Filtering: Remove points that are at a certain distance from other points, such as removing single noisy points.</li> <li>Intensity-Based Filtering: As already mentioned, useful if there is information about the intensity of the reflected laser signal.</li> </ul> <p>In conclusion, filtering is a great tool to clean and process our point clouds for better analysis. In our practice exercise, we'll see how to use \"Filter by value\" to choose the data we want.</p>"},{"location":"ex4/Point%20Classification%20and%20Mesh%20Creation/#creating-3d-meshes","title":"Creating 3D Meshes","text":"<p>So, we've learned how to classify and filter point clouds. Now it\u2019s time to turn our data into 3D models. For this, we\u2019ll create a 3D mesh. What is a Mesh? A mesh is a way to show a 3D surface using polygons, usually triangles. Imagine you connect all the points on the surface with many small triangles. This makes a mesh model that can be used for seeing the model, 3D printing, analysis, and other things.</p> <p>Why do we need meshes?</p> <p>Point clouds are good for showing data, but not always convenient for all tasks. Meshes, on the other hand, offer a more structured way to represent 3D geometry. Here are a few reasons why we create meshes: 1. Visualization: Meshes show 3D objects more clearly than point clouds. They let us see smooth surfaces, not just points. 2. 3D Modeling: Meshes are the basis for creating 3D models, used in games, architecture, and more. 3. Surface Analysis: Meshes let us measure areas, volumes, curvature, and other surface properties. 4. 3D Printing: Meshes are a format used for 3D printing, which lets us make real objects from digital models.</p> <p>Main Mesh Creation Algorithms in CloudCompare CloudCompare has several algorithms for making meshes from point clouds. We\u2019ll look at two main ones: 1. Delaunay Triangulation: This is a simple algorithm that connects points into triangles so that no points are inside the circles around any triangle.      * How it works: Delaunay builds triangles to best fill the space between points.      * Features: It is quick and good for simple shapes, but can create \u201crough\u201d edges and is not good for complex surfaces. It is also very sensitive to noise.</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Poisson Reconstruction: This uses the Poisson equation to make a smooth surface from a point cloud.<ul> <li>How it works: Poisson tries to fill the gaps between points to create a smooth surface.</li> <li>Features: It is more accurate and creates smoother surfaces than Delaunay. It is less sensitive to noise, but needs adjusted parameters like depth and the amount of points for analysis. The algorithm needs more computing power.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Comparing Algorithms</p> <p>The choice of algorithm depends on the task and type of data. Here\u2019s a quick comparison:</p> Feature Delaunay Triangulation Poisson Reconstruction Speed Fast Slower Quality Can be rough Smooth surface Complexity Good for simple shapes Good for complex shapes Sensitivity to noise High Less sensitive Parameter adjustment Not required Required <p>For our exercise, we\u2019ll use Poisson Reconstruction, as it creates better, more accurate models, especially for complex shapes.</p> <p>Now you have an understanding of what meshes are and how to create them in CloudCompare.

Discovered in September 1967, the shipwreck garnered significant interest but faced excavation challenges due to logistical and financial constraints, leading to only five short-term rescue research campaigns totaling 54 working days. After a 45-year hiatus, the project resumed in 2012 with a trial campaign, followed by systematic annual excavations.</p> <p></p> <p>Given the site's complexity and time constraints, photogrammetry emerged as an efficient and effective tool for recording the excavated areas, including the cargo, equipment, and hull remains.

This approach addresses the labor-intensive and error-prone process of manually measuring and modeling thousands of rivets typically found in such structures. The methodology was tested on both laboratory specimens and a full-scale real bridge.</p> <p>Riveting was a prevalent joining technique in iron and steel constructions from the mid-19th to early 20th centuries. Many of these riveted structures remain in use today and are considered significant cultural heritage. Maintaining and conserving such structures is essential, and Historic Building Information Modeling (HBIM) has emerged as a valuable tool for monitoring and preservation efforts. In this context, accurately modeling rivets is crucial for assessing structural safety and health over time. Given that these structures can contain thousands of rivets, manual measurement and modeling are labor-intensive and prone to errors.</p> <p>To address this challenge, the authors developed a methodology that automates the identification and 3D modeling of rivets from Lidar data. They tested their approach on both laboratory specimens and a full-scale real bridge, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately detecting and modeling rivets. This advancement has significant implications for the efficient maintenance and conservation of historical iron and steel structures, enhancing the precision and reliability of HBIM processes.</p> <p>The researchers used CloudCompare for the processing of the point cloud. Firstly, a region of interest (ROI) that contains the surface of the joint where the position of the rivets is to be detected was selected. Then to avoid problems with possible outliers due to noise, a Statistical Outlier Removal (SOR) filter to remove outliers of the ROI point cloud was applied.</p> <p></p> <p>The main part of geometrical modelling was provided using SolidWorks, but the authors used CloudCompare for comparing 3D solid model of the bridge with the scanned point cloud using the inbuilt capabilities of CC software. Once the point cloud is overlapped on the 3D model of the riveted joint, the distances between them are calculated by means of the \u201cCompute cloud/mesh distance\u201d function of CloudCompare, obtaining the results shown in figure below and quantified in the histogram. This histogram shows the deviation for each zone of the point cloud in the form of a color code (clusters). The rivet heads (displayed in blue) show a negative deviation; that is, the model protrudes above the point cloud. This effect is because the rivets have been modeled as regular hemispheres (mainly for the sake of simplifying the modeling process) while the real ones have a flatter head due to the riveting process (see figure below).</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"ex5/Practical%20Applications/#cloudcompare-for-architecture","title":"CloudCompare for architecture","text":"<p> The article \"Advances in the Restoration of Buildings with LIDAR Technology and 3D Reconstruction: Forged and Vaults of the Refectory of Santo Domingo de Orihuela (16th Century)\" presents a comprehensive study on the restoration of the Refectory of Santo Domingo in Orihuela, Spain, utilizing modern technologies such as Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and photogrammetry.</p> <p>The authors detail the restoration process aimed at achieving structural stability and restoring both the refectory area on the ground floor and the upper space on the first floor for use as teaching workshops.

The plugin leverages algorithms to isolate and identify individual trees or tree components, such as trunks and crowns, from dense point clouds.</p> <p>There are 5 key features of the TreeIso plugin: * Tree segmentation: The plugin identifies and separates individual trees in a point cloud dataset, even in dense forest areas. It segments tree trunks, branches, and crowns into distinct clusters. * Crown delineation: TreeIso helps delineate the crown of each tree by clustering points based on their height and spatial distribution. This is essential for estimating canopy dimensions and analyzing forest structure. * Trunk detection: The plugin can identify tree trunks, which are critical for volume estimation and biomass calculations. Trunk detection is based on the cylindrical shape of the tree stems and their vertical alignment. * Cluster-based processing: The plugin uses advanced clustering techniques to group points into individual tree components. These clusters can be visualized or exported for further analysis. * Parameter customization:  Users can fine-tune segmentation parameters, such as clustering thresholds, tree height ranges, and ground-filtering options. These parameters allow for handling varying tree densities and point cloud qualities.</p> <p>The main advantages of TreeIso plugin are: * Efficient handling of dense point clouds. * High accuracy in segmenting individual trees and their components. * Customizable parameters for diverse forest types and tree densities.</p> <p>On the other hand, there are some limitations of the plugin: * Performance may decrease with very large point clouds or complex forest structures. * Dense overlapping crowns in natural forests can pose challenges for segmentation accuracy. * Requires high-quality point clouds (e.g., LiDAR) for best results.</p> <p>The TreeIso plugin was developed in 2023, based on the article Xi, Z.; Hopkinson, C. 3D Graph-Based Individual-Tree Isolation (Treeiso) from Terrestrial Laser Scanning Point Clouds.
